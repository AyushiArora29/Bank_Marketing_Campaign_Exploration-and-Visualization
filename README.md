Data exploration and visualization project on bank_marketing_campaign dataset using python Data Exploration and Visualization Project on Bank Marketing Campaign using Python

By Yogesh Sachdeva, Ayushi Arora and Kriti Suri

INTRODUCTION- The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

Objectives of the Project

1.To explore the dataset for understanding the variables

2.To perform the data cleaning

3.To do the Data Visualization

4. Conclusions

Dataset Information
**Ai. bank client data:

1 - age: (numeric)
2 - job: type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')
3 - marital: marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)
4 - education: (categorical: primary, secondary, tertiary and unknown)
5 - default: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
6 - housing: has housing loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
7 - loan: has personal loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
8 - balance: Balance of the individual.

**Aii. Related with the last contact of the current campaign:

8 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone')
9 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')
10 - day: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')
11 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.

**Aiii. other attributes:

12 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
13 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
14 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
15 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')

**Output variable (desired target):
21 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')
